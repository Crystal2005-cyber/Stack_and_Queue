Stacks and queues are fundamental linear data structures used in computer science to organize and manage data. They differ primarily in the order in which elements are added and removed.
----------------
Stack:
A stack follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
Imagine a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only remove the top plate.

Primary operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Returns the top element without removing it.

Applications: Function call management (call stack), expression evaluation, undo/redo mechanisms, backtracking algorithms. 
-------------------
Queue:
A queue follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
Imagine a line of people waiting: the first person in line is the first one to be served.

Primary operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear (or end) of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
Front/Peek: Returns the element at the front without removing it.
Rear: Returns the element at the rear without removing it.

Applications: Task scheduling, print spooling, breadth-first search algorithms, managing shared resources. 
---------------------
Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Their choice depends on the specific requirements of the application, including efficiency considerations for insertion and deletion operations.
